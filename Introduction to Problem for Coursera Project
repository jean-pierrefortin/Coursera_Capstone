### Capstone Project Course!

Hello,

With this project, I wanted to find out many things regarding international students at a particular college.
At a particular department, they deal with many students on a regular basis for different services. 
Most students come for their services and I wanted to use this as a way to gather information about the students.
So, I will create a survey to gather this information to not only gather data in general, 
but to see how the department is doing, and analyze the results. 
This not only helps me with my research, but could also help the department understand their strenghts and weaknesses, 
and see where they can improve. After I have gathered my information, I will see where the data takes me. But, 
I can already tell, I have many ideas in mind after that. :)

Let's get started!!
